<h2>final project ideas </h2>

<p>1. I'm fascinated by all of the data available <a href="http://www.wrestlingdata.com">here</a>. I'd like to compare the win-loss data for a few major wrestlers with WWE's <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=WWE+Basic+Chart">stock values</a> as well as viewership data. I think it would be really interesting to see if there are any correlations with storylines and stock value/viewership, and whether or not the company ever has to make a decision to honor one or the other. For instance, I've already noticed that during one big storyline in the summer of 2011, WWE's stock value doubled, but then dropped off again as things settled down with the characters. In the end, I'd hope to have an interactive line graph in which viewers can pick one of a few wrestlers and see how that line matches up with the stock values. I'd also point out major storyline events (debut, winning titles, pay-per-view appearances etc) to see if they would explain any sudden spikes or drops. One issue I might run into though, is that wrestling is only one part of the WWE. Their merchandise sales and movie production company are also helping out with stock value and revenue.</p> 

<p>2. For something a little more sciencey and serious, I'm also morbidly fascinated by the idea of subway suicides/subway deaths in general. Inspired by the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/sandbox/business/subway.html">New Yorker's income map</a>, I'd like to make a subway map of the most deadly stops/lines. Things I need to know about each death: date, location, which line goes there. It might also be kind of cool to include crimes happening above ground, but at the station. <a href="https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/operating/osss/ptsb/rail/accident-reports/search">This</a> is a pretty helpful resource, but I can't seem to find their data in a more helpful format. The data here also seem to have not been updated in a while and don't have the most recent reports from this year. The <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/subway_suicide_trip_c9mOuc5ysBTgLzBjtHnzeI">NY Post</a> had to FOIA the last 3 years worth of data to get anything useful, I don't know if there's any way for me to get my hands on that data?</p>
