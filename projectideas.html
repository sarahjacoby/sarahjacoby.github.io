<h2>final project ideas</h2>

<p>1. I'm fascinated by all of the data available <a href="http://www.wrestlingdata.com">here</a>. I'd like to compare the win-loss data for each wrestler with WWE's <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=WWE+Basic+Chart">stock values</a> as well as viewership data. I think it would be really interesting to see if there are any correlations with storylines and stock value/viewership, and whether or not the company ever has to make a decision to honor one or the other. For instance, I've already noticed that during one big storyline in the summer of 2011, WWE's stock value doubled, but then dropped off again as things settled down with the characters. In the end, I'd hope to have an interactive line graph in which viewers can pick one of a few wrestlers and see how that line matches up with the stock values. I'd also point out major storyline events.</p>
