<h1> final project rando stuff</h1>
	<p>all of my data is coming from <a href="https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/operating/osss/ptsb/rail/accident-reports/search">here</a>. but they don't have very much of it there... gosh darn government data! i found 49 usable reports of fatalities there, but we know from other people that there are about 50 fatal subway accidents <b>per year</b>! so something's not right. the 2009 data appear to be the most complete. it might make sense to just include deaths from that year.</p>

	<p>when it comes time to actually make this thing, the MTA has put a lot of stuff up <a href="http://www.mta.info/developers/download.html">here</a>. the hexcodes for their colors are <a href="http://www.mta.info/developers/resources/line_colors.htm">here</a>. i'm going to need some guidance on how to make a thing out of this though...</p>

	<p>thank god <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#FieldDefinitions">this</a> exists. i think this means i can use google maps rather than trying to figure out an MTA map? maybe i can use latitude and longitude if nothing else.</p>

	<p>i'm kind of using that new yorker map as a reference, they have all of their data available to look at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ApL2ZVhpOmONdFdTUWhxV252elNORVNqT0g5Y0NzV1E&output=html">here</a>. so i should probably model my excel sheet after this one to see what i need to include and what i don't from the gtfs files.</p>

	<p>but of course i can just use a google maps overlay - apparently there's one for the nyc subway system. i'll need to find that and merge it with my fatalities data. monday!</p>
