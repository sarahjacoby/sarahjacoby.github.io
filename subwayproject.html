		<p> According to the <a href="http://www.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/">MTA</a>, over 1.5 billion people ride the subway every year. And, according to MTA data obtained by the New York Post this June, about 50 people of those 1.5 billion die in the subway annually. Suicides, usually classified as "non passenger" deaths attributed to "unsafe actions," are the most common form of subway death. The data used to create this map is from accident reports collected and <a href="https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/operating/osss/ptsb-repository/rail-reports/">published online</a> by the NY Department of Transportation. But because there are only 49 fatality reports available online, we know this data set is currently incomplete. However, this data does include both passenger (blue) and non passenger (red) fatalities. <b>Two thirds</b> of the fatalities recorded here were non passenger fatalities. </p>
<h3>There are 21 subway lines. These are the deadliest ones, each with 4 fatalities:</h3>

<h3>Of the 468 subway stations, these are the deadliest stops. With so many stops, deaths are pretty evenly distributed across them. Only these stops had more than one fatality:</h3>
